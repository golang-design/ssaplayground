## Deployment

There are two approaches to use the SSA Playground: native execution
or Docker-based deployment.

To execute natively, you can just use:

```bash
$ make
```

If you have Docker, then you can use:

```bash
$ make build # build the docker image
$ make up    # run/update for latest image
```

Then access http://localhost:6789/gossa.
